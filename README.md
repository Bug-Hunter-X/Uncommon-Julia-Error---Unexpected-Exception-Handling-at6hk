# Uncommon Julia Error: Unexpected Exception Handling

This repository demonstrates a potential source of unexpected behavior in Julia related to exceptions and the use of the `error()` function.  The example shows a function that throws an exception if a negative input is provided. While functional, it's less robust than other exception handling strategies.  The solution shows how to incorporate a `try-catch` block for a more controlled and graceful approach.

The primary issue addressed is how exceptions halt code execution, potentially masking other issues or making debugging harder. The solution improves this by gracefully handling the exception.
